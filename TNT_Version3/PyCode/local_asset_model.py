# 191218DJH: This class originally inherited from class Model. Model is being deleted. Its properties and methods are

class LocalAsset(object):
    # A local asset model manages and represents a local asset object, meaning that it
    # (1) determines a power schedule across all active time intervals,
    # (2) calculates costs that are needed by system optimization, and
    # (3) models flexibility, if any, that is available from the control of this asset in active time intervals.
    #
    # This base class provides many of the properties and methods that will be needed to manage local assets--generation
    # and demand alike. However, it schedules only the simplest, constant power throughout active time intervals.
    # Subclassing will be required to perform dynamic power scheduling, especially where scheduling is highly
    # constrained or invokes optimizations. Even then, implementers might need further subclassing to model their unique
    # assets.
    #
    # Available subclasses that inherit from this base class: (This taxonomy is influenced by the thesis (Kok 2013).
    # Inelastic - dynamic scheduling independent of prices
    # Shiftable - schedule a fixed utility over a time range
    # Buffering - schedule power while managing a (thermal) buffer
    # Storage - optimize revenue, less cost
    # Controllable - unconstrained scheduling based on a polynomial production or utility def
